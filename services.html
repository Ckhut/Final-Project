        <p class="paragraph">Prospective homebuyers come to showings equipped with more information than ever before and often have tentatively concluded which home they want to purchase before ever even setting foot in a house or speaking with you.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Because this technology is only now becoming available to all, most home listings still donâ€™t feature aerial photos or videos, thus creating a tremendous opportunity for you to stand apart from other agents and influence clients early.
